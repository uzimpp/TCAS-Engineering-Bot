# To be honest
- I used many tools to fix most of the problems which I had found since I started this project from literally 0 to be able to complete this project.
- I have learned so many many things such as planning a bot. For a further explanation, I have to arrange which functions should be in the chatbot neither nor. This taught me how to code quite a lot.


# Keep this in mind
THIS CHATBOT LELIES THE INFORMATION ON TCAS66 (Thai University Central Admission System in 2566 BE or 2023 CE), SO, THE GIVEN INFORMATION FROM MY CHATBOT IS MAY NOT BE A CURRENT INFORMATION (probably not)
